# Anxious Intelligence
 Anxious Intelligence explores how an artificial intelligence can experience the same states of mind that humans do, such as anxiety and introversion. Anxious Intelligence is represented as a particle system that wanders around a projected screen. Anxious Intelligence uses the Kinect to determine how many people are in a room with it, how close they are, and how quickly they are approaching it. The Anxious Intelligence will then react appropriately, flashing red, becoming more violent, breathing heavier and faster, and creating more disturbing sounds if people approach it too quickly or there are too many people in the room.
